\label{detbeamtest}

The primary goals of DUNE are to 
constrain or discover CP violation in the lepton sector by determining 
the value of the
CP violating phase, $\delta_{CP}$, in the PMNS mixing matrix and
to determine the mass ordering of the three neutrino mass eignestates. 
This will be accomplished through measurement of 
appearance rate of electron neutrinos and electron anti-neutrinos 
as well as the corresponding disappearance rate of muon neutrinos 
and muon anti-neutrinos over the 1300~km baseline of the experiment. 
Other important physics goals include sensitive searches for proton decay and detection of supernova neutrinos.

The full power of the DUNE experiment to perform a careful test of the three-flavor paradigm will come from a measurement of the detected neutrino spectral shape over a broad energy range.  For a baseline of 1300 km the first maximum of the oscillation probability occurs in the 2 - 3 GeV energy range with additional oscillation maxima at lower energies so the high intensity neutrino flux must be maximized in this energy range. It is desirable to have sufficient flux in the sub-GeV energy range to enable a measurement of the rapidly changing spectral shape in the region of the second maximum in the oscillation probability. It is this requirement on the neutrino energy spectrum, and the subsequent energy range of charged particles that result from their interactions, that determines the performance requirements for the DUNE detectors. 


One of the main goals of the single-phase prototype test beam program is to perform measurements 
needed to control and understand systematic uncertainties in DUNE oscillation measurements.
%The program also includes measurements to support other important DUNE physics measurements as described below.

\subsection{Summary of Detector and Beam Requirements }
\label{detbeam_main}

LAr TPC technology was first proposed for use in neutrino experiments by C. Rubbia in 1977
\cite{CRubbia} but extensive use in neutrino experiments is only now being realized. 
%CERN-EP-INT-77-8
%Title 	The liquid-argon time projection chamber : a new concept for neutrino detectors
%operating in the CNGS beamline  (with mean beam energy $\sim$17 GeV)~\cite{ICARUSmain}. 
The ICARUS T600 detector~\cite{icarus_mainref} pioneered the first large-scale detector when it operated in the CNGS 
neutrino beam at mean energy $\sim$17 GeV. ArgoNeuT~\cite{argoneut1}\cite{argoneut2} recently studied 
neutrino interactions in the NuMI beam down to sub-GeV energies with a small-scale (170~l fiducial volume) detector. 
While these samples are proving useful, they do not allow full isolation of
the low energy neutrino interaction processes
and final states from reconstruction and detector effects. 
The use of this technology in future precision neutrino experiments will require dedicated 
information on particle response
in the sub-GeV to few-GeV range provided by charged-particle test beams. 

%%%
%\subsubsection{Particles energy and direction}
%\label{detbeam_particles}
The DUNE experiment will run in both neutrino and anti-neutrino 
configurations. These beams will be composed  mainly of muon neutrinos (anti-neutrinos) as well as electron neutrinos (anti-neutrinos). In Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_momenta} the distributions of momenta and angles of particles created in neutrino interactions from 
simulated beam fluxes, including oscillation effects, are shown. The particle rates are calculated for a 34kt far detector and  are combined from both neutrino and anti-neutrino beams.
% In addition the electron rates from charged current interactions for muon neutrinos oscillated to electron neutrinos are shown.

The detector is designed from components that match exactly the current DUNE reference far detector design components. 
The test beam detector must be sufficiently large in both
longitudinal and transverse dimensions to contain showering particles up to the energy range of interest ($\sim$10~GeV).
Fig.~\ref{fig:containment} shows the simulated longitudinal and transverse 
energy containment for proton showers up to 10~GeV in energy.
For 10 GeV showers, more than 95\% of the energy is contained in a detector of longitudinal size of 6~m and 
radius of 2.5~m. Showers from pions, kaons, and electrons have also been studied and better containment
is achieved in those cases.

Pions and protons spanning the energy range expected in DUNE beam neutrino interactions will be used 
primarily to study hadronic showering reconstruction and calibration as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:showers}
 as well as particle identification (PID) algorithms discussed in Sec.~\ref{detbeam_pid}. A sample of 600K
 2~GeV $\pi^+$ will be used to study  secondary $\pi^o$ over a large angular range 
to tune and calibrate electron/photon separation algorithms (see Sec.~\ref{sec_egam}).
A large sample (10$^{6}$) 1 GeV protons will produce a sample of low energy stopping protons over a 
wide angular range needed to study angular
dependent effects on collected charge as described in Sec.~\ref{sec_angle}.
Electrons will be used to benchmark and tune  electron/photon separation algorithms and to calibrate 
electromagnetic showers as discussed in \ref{sec_egam}.
Muon (and antimuon) samples are needed to study reconstruction and PID calibration as well as to obtain 
Michel electron events for calibration  
algorithms for charge-sign determination (see Secs.\ref{sec_reco} and \ref{sec_other}).

Charged-kaon samples will be useful to characterize kaon PID efficiency for proton decay sensitivity but
are a somewhat lower priority need. The antiproton sample
will be helpful for exotic physics sensitivity studies. Both of these lower priority requests are discussed
in Sec.~\ref{sec_other}.

%and to tune PID algorithms (statistics shown will far exceed 1\% uncertainty on the mean for 
%EM showers with resolution on the order of 1\% as measured in DOCDB 9434 and 8835. 100k Electron event samples will allow

%Proton response will be studied for reconstruction and to tune PID 
%algorithms. Kaon data will be needed to tune proton decay backgrounds .
%Special runs at various angles with $\pi$, $\mu$, p and electrons will be performed to study reconstruction and tune PID algorithms. 

\subsection{Detector performance tests}

The prototype detector will allow to study the detector response to charge particles from the test beam. The measured energy deposition for various particles and its dependence on the direction of the particle will be used to tune
Monte Carlo simulations and allow more precise reconstruction of neutrino energy and interactions topologies with good particle identification.


\subsubsection{Shower calibration}
\label{sec:showers}

Accurate measurement of neutrino energy will require reconstruction of both electromagnetic and hadronic showers. Reconstruction of hadron energy 
in these energy ranges will require knowledge of the fate (interact, decay, or stop) of the
initiating hadron ($\pi^{+/-}$, $p$, or $K^{+/-}$).
%fate (interact, decay, or stop). 
For the case of  interacting hadrons the composition of secondaries
will need to be determined to characterize the response. 
These will include neutrals and particles which 
deposit energy electromagnetically ($\pi^o$, $\gamma$), as well as
secondary hadrons,
%and their energy responses 
The test beam with known incoming particle type and momentum will be used
to characterize interacting hadrons in this energy range.

Fig.~\ref{fig:hadronshwr} shows the fraction of true energy deposited by interacting protons with 1~GeV/c (left) and
3~GeV/c (right) incident momenta simulated using FLUKA particle transport code~\cite{fluka05}. 
Interacting protons (65\% of the 1~GeV/c sample) are selected.
% The remaining 
%35\% which range out are be used to study particle identification algorithms (PID) (see Sec.~\ref{detbeam_pid}). 
%Reconstruction is performed with ICARUS spatial and calorimetric reconstruction algorithm~\cite{icarus_reco}.
For this study, visible energy is summed using hit information with corrections applied for the lifetime of 
the drift electrons. (No attempt is made here to correct for recombination effects or electromagnetic shower fractions). 
The resulting energy deposition in the two cases cannot be 
accurately characterized by an average shower calibration factor. Monte Carlo simulations of 
outgoing particles, especially at low energies, must be checked and bench-marked against calibration data to avoid
large uncertainties from shower modeling.

Pion showers at low energies will also be important both for determining the interacted neutrino energy as well
as for modeling neutral current backgrounds resulting from $\pi^o$ content in showers. Significant
 differences in energy deposited in interactions initiated
by $\pi^+$ versus $\pi^-$  are present up to momenta on the order of 1~GeV/c due to different
final state particles and interaction cross sections. This is illustrated in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:pionshwr} which shows the differences in mean energy deposited (left) and width (right) 
for interacting pions ranging from 0.2~GeV/c up to 5~GeV/c momenta.

\subsubsection{Cross section measurements}


Final state pions are produced copiously in neutrino interactions in our energy range 
of interest
and contribute substantially to total visible energy in the interaction.
These particles can re-interact or be absorbed in the nuclear medium
and substantially change the visible energy deposited in the event. 
Effects of modeling final state pion interactions on reconstructed neutrino energy have 
been recently demonstrated in the NuMI and Booster beam energy ranges~\cite{miniboonefsi, minervafsi}. 

Existing data used to tune the models
cover limited energies ($<$200~MeV) and are primarily on lighter target nuclei~\cite{fsirev}.
% need to check this reference from R. Ransom talk.
The requested $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ samples will allow new data samples for measuring
exclusive final state processes over the full relevant energy range and specifically on argon nuclei. 


%\item pion absorption on argon - Kotlinski, EPJ 9, 537 (2000)
%\item pion cross section as a function of A - Gianelli PRC 61, 054615 (2000)

%There is not currently a satisfactory theory describing absorption. The Valencia group (Vicente-Vacus NPA 568, 855 (1994)) developed model of    the pion-nucleus reaction with fairly good agreement, although not in detail. The actual  mechanism of multi-nucleon absorption
% is not well understood. 
 


\subsubsection{Angular Dependence}

\label{sec_angle}

%Ionization charge deposited by charged-particles in the LAr TPC must be calibrated to
%account for recombination effects. 

A track angular dependent correction must be
%Track angle must be accounted for and a correction
applied to deposited charge to accurately calibrate
dE/dx that is used for track momentum and particle ID (see Sec.~\ref{detbeam_pid}). 
An additional angular dependent effect could be present 
due to charge recombination. 
% effects could also be angular dependent. 
%It this is the case
%this will introduce a component that is currently not modeled. 
For example, Jaffe columnar recombination model~\cite{jaffe,argoneut_angle} predicts 
angular dependence given by 
$$Q \approx \frac{Q_o}{1+k_c (dE/dx) / {\cal E} \sin\phi}, $$ 
where
%Recombination modeling 
$Q_o$ and $Q$ are the ionization charge and the collected charge respectively, 
%$dE/dx$ is range based stopping power.
$k_c$ is a constant that depends on LAr diffusion and mobility coefficients, $\cal E$ 
is the electric field strength, and $\phi$ is the angle relative to the drift direction.
%
ICARUS~\cite{icarus_recombination} and LArSoft default recombination models do not currently incorporate angular dependence. 
%(ArgoNeuT~\cite{arogneut_angle} suggests a 
%modified Box model with explicit angular dependence can be incorporated 
%into Birk's law  by replacing ${\cal E}$  with ${\cal E} \sin\phi$).
Recent results from ArgoNeuT~\cite{argoneut_angle} find a small unmodeled
angular dependence in a data sample obtained using stopping protons from 
neutrino interactions in the range 50-300 MeV with angles in the range 40-90$^{\circ}$.

Additional data covering a large angular range would be useful to further investigate this possibility.
The large sample of 1~GeV protons requested will also be used to study angular dependence using 
samples of secondary stopping protons produced in showers at a range of angles with
respect to the field direction.

\subsubsection{Bethe-Bloch parametrization of charged particles and PID}

%
\label{detbeam_pid}

%The reconstruction of events in the LAr TPC is still a challenge but rapid progress has been achieved in recent years (cite pandora and other reconstruction algorithms). Despite the progress reconstruction algorithms have to rely Monte Carlo predictions which don't simulate liquid argon detectors responses correctly. Reconstruction algorithms will benefit greatly from test beam data particularly from the full scale prototype.

%The data of tracks and showers can be used to create a library of reference events with which to tune algorithms.

\subsubsection{Reconstruction Effects}
\label{sec_reco}

Reconstruction algorithms use all three signal planes for 3D track and event reconstruction. The quality of reconstruction is affected by two main factors that can be quantified with test beam data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The complexity of the event topology, which includes the number of objects overlapping in 2D projections and the number of possible object associations between 2D projections. The topology complexity depends on the energy of incident particle. Hadronic showers collected with the test beam can provide data sample to assess the reconstruction algorithm performance and test its dependence on the incident particle energy.
\item Orientation of the reconstructed object w.r.t. the readout wires and electron drift direction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracks and cascades in the plane parallel or almost parallel to the signal planes have strongly limited variation of the hit drift time, required for the 3D reconstruction; various reconstruction algorithms can show different performance in real detector conditions for such inclined objects, especially in the presence of noise affecting hit time reconstruction.
\item A 2D projection of objects aligned with the wires of one of the planes is strongly shortened, which limits the amount of information available to the reconstruction algorithm; the two other signal planes can be used for spatial reconstruction, however, the validation of the correctness of reconstruction, calculated from the 3D object projected to the third plane, is less efficient.
The most important aspect of this issue is the use of all planes for the charge measurement. If the reconstructed object is aligned with collection wires then the calorimetric measurement has to be carried out with the signal from the induction planes. The additional shielding wire plane in the DUNE design will improve the quality of the bipolar induction plane signals.  The test beam 
data will help with the calibration of these signals.
\item Objects aligned with the drift field are projected onto a low
number of wires and have a large span of drift time. The wire signals in these
cases are significantly different than those from tracks at higher angles with
respect to the drift field, and therefore require a dedicated signal processing
algorithm to do hit reconstruction. Corrections for angular dependence of
recombination will also need to be included in the calorimetric reconstruction
and calibrated with real data.
%Objects aligned with the drift field are projected to a low number of wires and have a large span of drift time. Wire signals of such objects are significantly different than those of objects at higher angles w.r.t. the drift field, requiring a dedicated signal processing for the hit reconstruction. In such orientation also the correction of eventual angular dependence of the recombination effect should be included in the calorimetric reconstruction and calibrated with real data.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%Main issues for the reconstruction algorithms:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Reconstruction algorithms use all three signal planes for 3D track and event reconstruction. 
%If the orientation of the track/shower is such that it is aligned with wires on one of the planes, it significantly reduces quality of reconstructed objects. 
%\item Calorimetry with collection and induction planes. In the ICARUS experiment the deposited energy was reconstructed from the signal on the collection plane. The induction planes bipolar signal wasn't "stable" enough to use it for calorimetric measurement. In the ELBNF design there is additional shielding  wire plane which will improve the quality of the bipolar signal and the  test beam experiment will help with its calibration.
%\item   Vertexing.
%\item Reconstruction efficiency for low energy particles. The reconstruction algorithm suffer from the lose of efficiency for low energy particle or particles which leave less than 200-300 hits. Training the algorithms on a low energy particles from the test beam will improve the quality and efficiency of the reconstructed objects.
%\end{itemize}

Any reconstruction algorithm will depend on the particular choices in the TPC design. 
Therefore bench-marking our reconstruction algorithms with a prototype of the final design will
be invaluable to understand the performance of reconstruction.

\subsubsection{e/$\gamma$ separation}
\label{sec_egam}

The search for a CP violation phase using $\nu_e$ appearance 
in a $\nu_\mu$ beam requires good electron/photon separation.
Backgrounds originating from photons produced primarily from 
final state $\pi^0$'s must be identified and removed from the signal
electron sample. 

High energy photons can undergo two process: pair production and Compton scattering. 
The dominant process for photons with energies of several hundred MeV is 
e$^+$ e$^-$ pair production.
%energies. 
%For pair production the 
e/$\gamma$ discrimination
for this process can be achieved using the beginning of the electromagnetic shower, where 
a single MIP is characteristic of electron energy deposition while two MIPs is consistent 
with a photon hypothesis.
In the case where the photon Compton scatters, the two particles cannot easily be distinguished
from the energy deposition pattern.

Background rejection as a function of signal

on incoming particle energy in the range of interest. 
Greater than 90\% background rejection can be 
achieved with $>$70\% efficiency for energies above 300~MeV. (Above 1~GeV 
rejection is even greater at high efficiency).
Our studies indicate that rejection and efficiency depend 
on particular features of the geometry including wire pitch and plane 
orientation which affect the reconstruction.

rejection versus signal efficiency for simulated

\subsubsection{Supernova and Michel electrons}

Neutrinos produced in supernova explosions since the first stars formed in the universe constitute the
diffuse relic supernova neutrino background. The DUNE Far detector could have unique sensitivity to these
few-to-30-MeV range $\nu_e$'s. 
The test beam cannot offer a sample of  such low energy electrons, but Michel electrons  produced by 
decaying stopped muons is ideal to calibrate electron response in the appropriate 10-50~MeV energy range. 
The requested sample of low energy muons will supply the 1400 Michel electrons required for a 1\% 
calibration of electrons in this energy range.

\subsubsection{Charge sign determination}

It is not possible to determine the charge of the particle on an event by event basis with non-magnetized LAr TPC detectors. A statistical separation will be studied which will make use of differences in muon versus anti-muon capture cross sections and lifetime.
%However, the statistical analyst will be possible. We will fit the muon's half time which is different for muons and antimony due to different muon capture cross sections. 
For the $\mu^-$ we expect about 99.9\% to be captured on argon whereas essentially all $\mu^+$ decay \cite{stopmu}.
Charge-sign tagged $\nu_\mu$ samples may be useful to constrain exotic possibilities such as
non-standard neutrino interactions which predict particle-antiparticle survival probability differences. 


\subsubsection{Proton decay sensitivity and background samples}


The DUNE experiment in the deep underground location will seek to detect several modes of proton decay.
In particular, a first ever LAr detector of this scale underground will primarily improve sensitivity to 
proton decays with final state kaons such as  $p \rightarrow K^+ \overline{\nu}$. 
Sensitivity to this process is studied in \cite{bueno}. $K^+$ detection efficiency is estimated to be $>$97\% in the
appropriate momentum range (500-800 MeV/c). The kaon samples requested in Table~\ref{tab:runsum} are needed to directly measure 
$K^+$ PID and detection efficiency. 

Obtaining low energy kaons will likely be difficult in this beamline.
A sample of 13K beam kaons with 1~GeV/c momentum are requested to provide 2K stopping $K^+$ track samples for PID studies.
(only 15\% of $K^+$ stop at 1~GeV/c).

%proton &  1  &  (1M)  \\ \hline
%\end{tabular}\caption{Samples related to proton decay physics requirements.}
%\label{pdktable}
%\end{table}

A sizable sample of protons ($\sim 10^6$)
are requested to study the possible background contributions to  $p \rightarrow K^+ \overline{\nu}$.
This sample of  protons are needed to quantify the possibility that an interacting proton 
is  {\em mis-IDed} as stopping kaon. A proton interaction which produces neutrals and one charged pion 
(which is mis-IDed or subsequently decays to $\mu$) can fake the final state kaon signal.


\subsubsection{Anti-proton annihilation }

A sample of antiprotons would be useful to calibrate the $p$-$\overline{p}$ annihilation process. 
This would provide input to exotic baryon number-violating process in which neutron-antineutron oscillation
occurs and results in a
% (reference) modeling of 
subsequent  $n$-$\overline{n}$ annihilation. The modeling of $p\overline{p}$ annihilation could be
studied and tuned on a low-energy $\overline{p}$ beam sample and used to constrain the related modes 
expected for  $n$-$\overline{n}$ annihilation. These events would be tagged in the 
mixed-mode beam. Events in the sub-GeV range would be the most useful for this purpose.
