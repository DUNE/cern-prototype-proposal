Describe LBNF science and need to prototype and test detector performance


\begin{itemize}
\item short description of physics measurements of ELBNF
\item point to uncertainties in present knowledge of input parameters for sensitivity studies, lack of MC validation
\item validation of full scale detector components


\end{itemize}
